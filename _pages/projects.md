### BeatFlow (Hack K-State 2023)
BeatFlow elevates your running experience by syncing Spotify music with your cadence. Using your phone's accelerometer, it adjusts the track playing by energy to match your cadence.

### Deaflingo (Hack KU 2024)
Imagine if Duolingo met sign language. Learning sign language shouldn't just be a quick Google search. That's why we've developed a solution where your webcam can recognize your hands, enhancing your technique and making learning more intuitive than ever before.
